// this function shall determine the speed and path of each car.
// this function shall reside in supul server. 
// all supul servers shall compose decentralized federation with XMPP protocol. 
// each car-controller in each supul server shall control all cars in each region controlled by the supul server. 
// if one car starts from region A, and ends at the same region A, then the car is controlled by the supul of the region A. 
// if one car starts a region A and ends at region B, the car controlled by the supul server which encompasses both A and B. 
// this function shall determine the path, speed, and time etc of all cars in each region to maximize the benefit of the region or society rather than that of the car. 
// this function shall determine the priority among cars. for example, 911 have high priority than other cars. 
// this function shall give priority to each car. 
// this function is basically ML module.
